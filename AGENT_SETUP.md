# Agent Setup Guide

Use this file when an AI/dev agent is setting up the repo for a human.

## Goal

Install, build, validate, and generate MCP client config for the GoHighLevel MCP server without inventing credentials or running unsafe tools.

## Safety Rules

- Do not commit `.env`.
- Do not print full API keys.
- Do not run write/destructive GHL tools unless the human explicitly approves.
- Do not change `GHL_API_VERSION=2023-02-21` to 2026. It is the HighLevel API `Version` header, not the project year.
- Use `GHL_TOOL_PROFILE=curated` by default.
- Stop and ask the human for missing `GHL_API_KEY`, missing `GHL_LOCATION_ID`, invalid auth, or an unsupported MCP client.
- Treat Metricool as optional. If requested, ask for `METRICOOL_USER_TOKEN`, `METRICOOL_USER_ID`, and `METRICOOL_BLOG_ID`; never print the token.

## Minimum Setup

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
npm run build
npm run doctor
npm run agent:check
```

If `.env` already exists, do not overwrite it.

## No-Credentials Mode

If credentials are not available, still run:

```bash
npm run build
npm run doctor -- --json
npm run agent:check -- --skip-tests --no-network --json
npm run configure:codex
```

Report that live auth is blocked until the human supplies credentials.

## Credentials Mode

After the human supplies credentials, update `.env` and run:

```bash
npm run doctor
npm run auth-check
npm run agent:check
```

`auth-check` is read-only.

## Client Config

Generate the config for the requested client:

```bash
npm run configure:codex
npm run configure:claude
npm run configure:cursor
npm run configure:windsurf
```

Use `node scripts/ghl-mcp.mjs configure codex --profile stable` only when the human asks for a production/stable profile. Use `--profile full` only for advanced users.

## Optional Apps Preview

Only if requested:

```bash
npm run apps:setup
npm run apps:preview
```

Report `http://localhost:3001/preview` for local browser use. In cloud agent environments, localhost may not be visible to the human.

## Final Handoff Checklist

Report:

- Node version compatibility.
- Dependency install status.
- `.env` exists and was not committed.
- Build status.
- Test status, if tests were run.
- Doctor status.
- Auth status, if credentials were provided.
- MCP client config generated.
- Tool profile used.
- Metricool config status, if Metricool was requested.
- Remaining human actions.
- Confirmation that no write/destructive tools were run.
- Confirmation that no full secrets were printed.

## Copy/Paste Prompt

```text
Follow AGENT_SETUP.md and set this repo up for my MCP client using the curated tool profile. Ask me for GHL_API_KEY and GHL_LOCATION_ID if missing. Do not run write or destructive tools. Do not commit secrets. Finish with a short setup report and the MCP config I should use.
```

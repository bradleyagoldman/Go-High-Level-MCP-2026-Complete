# Usage

## Start The Server

```bash
npm run start:stdio
npm run start:http
npm run start:legacy
```

Most desktop MCP clients should use stdio.

## Tool Discovery

```bash
npm run tools:list -- --search contacts
npm run tools:list -- --category contacts
npm run tools:list -- --stability official
npm run tools:list -- --access read
npm run tools:list -- --access write
npm run tools:list -- --access delete
npm run tools:list -- --destructive
GHL_TOOL_PROFILE=curated npm run tools:list
```

Use the read-only views first when testing a new token/location.

## Easy Buttons

```bash
npm run first-run
npm run connect
npm run ready
npm run demo
npm run explain-error -- "Location is not active"
```

- `first-run` gives a setup grade and the next best command.
- `connect` runs setup and emits MCP client config.
- `ready` is the fast readiness check.
- `demo` prints the no-credentials MCP Apps preview path.
- `explain-error` turns common setup/API errors into plain next steps.

## Common Workflows

- Contacts: search, create, update, tag, dedupe, and add notes.
- Notes: create, update, list, and delete contact notes.
- Conversations: search threads, inspect messages, draft SMS/email replies.
- Appointments: inspect calendars, find slots, prepare bookings.
- Opportunities: list pipelines, inspect deals, prepare stage changes.
- Invoices: prepare invoices and billing workflows.
- Reviews: prepare review replies and review request workflows.
- Workflows: prepare safe workflow enrollment.
- Media: list and upload media where supported.
- Location health: inspect users, locations, setup health, and operational gaps.
- Metricool: check Metricool credential status, list brands, read scheduled posts, and fetch allowed analytics endpoints.

## Metricool Social Intelligence

Metricool tools are available in the `stable`, `full`, and `raw` profiles after setting `METRICOOL_USER_TOKEN`, `METRICOOL_USER_ID`, and usually `METRICOOL_BLOG_ID`.

Recommended live-read sequence:

```bash
npm run build
node scripts/ghl-mcp.mjs test-tool get_metricool_config_status
node scripts/ghl-mcp.mjs test-tool get_metricool_brands
node scripts/ghl-mcp.mjs test-tool get_metricool_scheduled_posts '{"start":"2026-06-01","end":"2026-06-30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles"}'
node scripts/ghl-mcp.mjs test-tool get_metricool_timeline_analytics '{"metric":"igFollowers","start":"2026-06-01","end":"2026-06-30"}'
```

The generic `get_metricool_read_endpoint` tool is intentionally limited to known read prefixes: `/admin/simpleProfiles`, `/stats/`, `/v2/analytics/`, and `/v2/scheduler/posts`.
